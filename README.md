 VJ Type Website Case Study

 ABOUT
 This is a project for the Web Development course at the Minneapolis College of Art & Design. For my project, I selected the VJ TYPE website (www.vj-type.com) and developed a design system study, a simple component library, and a final mockup of the home page recreated with some simplification.
